# homecluster
This is a forever-WIP testing ground for technology.
For now, it should run Kubernetes on whatever old hardware I can find in old boxes.
It should try to run fire dynamics simulations to show how well I can use available CPUs

# Current Plan
- [ ] Attempt to make old laptop usable by fixing BIOS error preventing hard drive recognition
- [ ] Use old laptop as control node of a k8s cluster, possibly with Talos OS
- [ ] Benchmark with a simple FDS fire dynamics simulation
- [ ] Attempt to add old Raspberry Pi as a node
- [ ] Attempt to add old Odroid SBC as as node
- [ ] Expose a web interface in LAN to run FDS simulations (upload, start/cancel, download result, running logs)
- [ ] Add a modern Raspberry Pi to the mix, equip it with a hat for PoE & SSD storage
- [ ] Consider refurbished HP Elite units or other cheap things with CPUs as an extension
- [ ] Get a rack with "drawers"
- [ ] Start a picture series of the boards next to performance measurements
- [ ] Research next cool capability, possibly AI or local cloud storage

# Running Log

 - Attempted to start old Laptop. Hard drive not recognized by BIOS. Got an analysis at PC repair shop: SSD is physically broken and needs replacement. I'm glad I had backups of everything.
